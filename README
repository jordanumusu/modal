## How It Works

Modal uses a FastAPI backend to:

- Accept user queries and route them through OpenAI's `responses.create` API
- Enrich responses with structured data pulled from:
  - [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) (live chord progression scraping)
  - [Spotify 12M Songs Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs)
- Upload missing song entries to the OpenAI Native Vector Store API
- Format output with markdown and suggestions for further exploration

The frontend uses Next.js and Tailwind CSS to render a responsive chat interface with animated chunked message reveal using custom `@theme` keyframe animations.
